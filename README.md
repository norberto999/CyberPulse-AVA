# CyberPulse-AVA


## About

CyberPulse-AVA is an internal cybersecurity platform developed for Avara Foods to improve employee security engagement, device compliance visibility, security awareness, and organisational cyber resilience.

This project is intended for internal use and is not currently distributed as a commercial product.

> Your Personal Cyber Security Command Centre

CyberPulse-AVA is a Microsoft-integrated cybersecurity companion platform that gives every employee a personalised security command centre. It combines CyberScore analytics, device compliance monitoring, threat intelligence, security awareness training, and AI-powered guidance from AVA to improve cyber resilience through engagement, visibility, and actionable insights.

## Vision

Most security platforms are built for SOC analysts. CyberPulse-AVA is built for everyone.

The goal is to transform cybersecurity from a reactive IT function into an engaging experience that helps employees understand, improve, and take ownership of their personal security posture.

## Core Features

### CyberScore™

CyberScore provides a simple way for users to understand their current cybersecurity posture. Score categories include Identity Security, Device Compliance, Security Awareness, and Risk Exposure. Users can track trends over time and receive personalised recommendations for improvement.

### Device Compliance Centre

View security and compliance information for managed devices, including device health, encryption, antivirus, firewall status, compliance policies, and non-compliance reasons. Supported platforms include Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android.

### Security Alert Feed

A central location for security alerts affecting users and devices, with severity prioritisation, alert filtering, resolution workflows, security context, and threat investigation assistance.

### AVA AI Security Assistant

AVA is CyberPulse's intelligent security assistant. It can explain security alerts, provide remediation guidance, answer cybersecurity questions, support security awareness, recommend improvements, and assist with incident investigations. Current development builds use mocked responses and are designed for future Microsoft Copilot Studio integration.

### Threat Intelligence Dashboard

CyberPulse consolidates intelligence from multiple security sources, including Darktrace and Pentera. This includes threat scores, anomalous devices, AI confidence levels, MITRE ATT&CK mapping, incident visibility, vulnerability findings, attack surface analysis, risk ratings, CVSS scoring, and remediation priorities.

### Security Learning Hub

A security awareness and training platform with learning modules, progress tracking, mandatory training, leaderboards, completion statistics, and security education resources.

### Microsoft Security Integration

CyberPulse-AVA is designed to integrate with Microsoft's security ecosystem, including Microsoft Entra ID, Microsoft Intune, Microsoft Defender, Microsoft Graph, and Microsoft Teams.
